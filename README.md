## ABOUT ME

Hello :-)

My name is Lesego Maponyane, and I'm a passionate data scientist with a strong desire to leverage the power of data to solve real-world problems.

What excites me about data science:

- Uncovering hidden insights: I find it fascinating to delve into data and uncover patterns and trends that might not be readily apparent. This ability to extract knowledge from information is what truly drives me.

- Problem-solving with data: I enjoy the challenge of taking a complex problem, formulating it into a data-driven question, and then using data analysis techniques to find solutions.

- Impact through data: The potential of data science to make a positive impact on various fields, from business to healthcare to social good, is incredibly motivating.
